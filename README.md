# Helmet Violation Detection using YOLOv8

This repository contains my **first end-to-end project in Computer Vision**, built as part of my learning journey into deep learning and real-world ML systems.

More than a final product, this repo reflects the **process I went through** — from understanding detection models to extracting insights and building user-oriented interactions.

## 🌟 What This Project Does

This work implements a complete pipeline to:

1. Train a YOLOv8 model for object detection on a helmet dataset
2. Run inference on test images to detect:
   - 🪖 With Helmet
   - ❌ Without Helmet
3. Extract structured detection results (CSV)
4. Perform Automated EDA (AutoEDA)
5. Provide a user-oriented Q&A system to query detection results
6. (Optional) Offer a simple Streamlit web interface
